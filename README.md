# Grouped-Successive-Multivariate-Variational-Mode-Decomposition
Grouped Successive Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (GSMVMD) is a multivariate signal decomposition algorithm for pattern decomposition of multi-channel EEG signals.
The MATLAB code of this algorithm will be made public when our paper is published.
